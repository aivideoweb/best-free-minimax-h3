# MiniMax H3 Video Prompt Library

> Adapted from the Flaq AI source cookbook with attribution. These 84 source recipes are separate from the [13 new free-tool practices](../docs/free-tool-prompts.md). Longer or multi-reference recipes need a compatible workflow. See [provenance](../docs/provenance.md).

> 84 original, production-oriented MiniMax H3 audiovisual prompt recipes across 24 practical categories. Every recipe was originally written for the Flaq AI source repository and designed around multimodal reference roles, controllable motion, continuity, and reviewable delivery.

**Prompt languages:** [English canonical library](./README.md) · [Multilingual ready-to-copy sampler](../docs/multilingual-prompting.md)

## H3-oriented recipe design

MiniMax's official H3 materials emphasize native text/image/audio/video understanding, precise multimodal editing and control, and commercial use across film, advertising, e-commerce, digital experiences, games, and animation. Recipes therefore separate four layers:

1. **Reference map:** what each image, video, or audio input is allowed to control;
2. **Creative brief:** deliverable, audience, story, visual language, and sound intent;
3. **Timeline:** readable beats, camera behavior, and state changes;
4. **Control contract:** identity locks, product locks, edit scope, constraints, and review risks.

The recipes do not invent API parameters. Confirm currently supported input types, model identifiers, limits, and request fields in the [official MiniMax H3 examples](https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/guides/video-prompt) and [video generation documentation](https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/guides/video-generation).

## How to use a recipe

1. Pick the closest deliverable, not just the closest visual style.
2. Replace every `[bracketed variable]`; remove unused reference inputs.
3. Keep reference roles narrow: identity, product, location, movement, rhythm, or sound—not “use everything from everything.”
4. Shorten or expand the timeline to match the duration available in your H3 interface.
5. Generate a structure pass first; then revise motion, identity, text, or sound one failure class at a time.
6. Verify the final output at normal speed, frame by frame, muted, and at delivery size.

All entries are creative specifications. A recipe is only marked as tested after its exact model/tool, inputs, settings, date, output, and material edits are recorded.
